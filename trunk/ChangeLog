	* tclgpg.tcl: Almost finished signature verification code (except
	  catching errors from gpg and returning plaintext attribute for
	  signatures which include the signed text).

	* tclgpg.tcl: Return plaintext attribute for non-detached signatures.

2008-09-06  Sergei Golovan  <sgolovan@nes.ru>

	* tclgpg.tcl: Implemented gpg calls for message signing, decryption
	  and signature verification. Results for signature verification
	  aren't ready yet.

2008-09-05  Sergei Golovan  <sgolovan@nes.ru>

	* tclgpg.tcl: Implemented message encryption with optional signing.
	  Since it is impossible to close only a writing half of a channel in
	  Tcl 8.5 or older, in order to be able to supply a passphrase to gpg
	  process a dependency on Tclx has to be introduced (command [pipe] is
	  used, or alternatively [chan pipe] from Tcl 8.6). Also, a few typos
	  in recipients code are fixed.

2008-09-04  Sergei Golovan  <sgolovan@nes.ru>

	* tclgpg.tcl: Implemented creating recipient token and its operations.

2008-09-03  Sergei Golovan  <sgolovan@nes.ru>

	* tclgpg.tcl: Added a check for working gpg executable on the package
	  load. Converted collecting gpg data into a channel because it has to
	  be configured to use UTF-8 encoding.

2008-09-02  Sergei Golovan  <sgolovan@nes.ru>

	* tclgpg.tcl: Catch gpg execution errors. Started to implement parsing
	  of keylist output. Traversing keylist is almost usable now.

	* tclgpg.tcl: Return error on start-trustitem, next-trustitem,
	  done-trustitem, info-trustitem operation because in GPGME the
	  corresponding operations use --list-trust-path option which isn't
	  supported by gpg anymore.

2008-09-01  Sergei Golovan  <sgolovan@nes.ru>

	* tclgpg.tcl, pkgIndex.tcl, license.terms: Started TclGPG library.

	* tclgpg.tcl: Preliminarily implemented gpg::info procedure and
	  start-key, next-key and done-key context operations (though they
	  are useless because gpg output parsing isn't implemented yet).
