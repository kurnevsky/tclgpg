	* tclgpg.tcl: Catch gpg execution errors. Started to implement parsing
	  of keylist output. Traversing keylist is almost usable now.

	* tclgpg.tcl: Return error on start-trustitem, next-trustitem,
	  done-trustitem, info-trustitem operation because in GPGME the
	  corresponding operations use --list-trust-path option which isn't
	  supported by gpg anymore.

	* tclgpg.tcl, pkgIndex.tcl, license.terms: Started TclGPG library.

	* tclgpg.tcl: Preliminarily implemented gpg::info procedure and
	  start-key, next-key and done-key context operations (though they
	  are useless because gpg output parsing isn't implemented yet).
